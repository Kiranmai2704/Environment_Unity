This project README provides a comprehensive guide on setting up the environment in Unity and integrating an avatar for interactive simulations. To begin, ensure you have Unity installed and configured with the necessary dependencies as outlined in the prerequisites. Start by creating a new Unity project or opening an existing one. Import essential assets such as terrain, models, and any required plugins. Configure the project settings to optimize performance and compatibility. Next, to add an avatar, import the avatar model and associated animations. Customize the avatar's appearance and behaviors through Unity's built-in tools or third-party plugins as needed. Ensure that animations are correctly rigged and integrated for smooth interaction within the simulation environment. This README aims to streamline the setup process, making it accessible for developers looking to create immersive experiences with avatars in Unity.
